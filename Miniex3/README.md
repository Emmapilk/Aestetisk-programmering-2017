<b> The concept and execution behind my throbber: </b> 
Afer understanding and trying out Winnie's code og a throbber, I knew I had to come up with an interpretation of what a throbber could consist of. I elaborated for a long time upon the different throbbers that i knew of, and tried to find a common factor for all of these loading ikons. I came to the conclusion, that even though throbbers can be very different from each other, they all have a factor in common; Throbbers all represent a period of time, where you're forced to wait for a certain amount of time, enable to have the opportunity to use the specific site. Due to this statement i found it evident to represent my throbber with actual time, as this is the root cause of the elemnt in the first place. 
After analysing Winnie's code and understanding it, it was relatively easy to compose a line of code which would constitute of my own idea of a throbber, at the same time as evolving around the code that Winnie provided us with. I have used a similar composition as to the one Winnie has provided us with, but it has been necessary to alter it, enable to make the code work for my own idea.
