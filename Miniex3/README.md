<b> The concept and execution behind my throbber: </b> 
Afer understanding and trying out Winnie's 'throbber'-code, I realised that I had to come up with an interpretation of what a throbber (i.e. loading-icon) could consist of. After finding and considering several different kinds of throbbers from various computer games and websites, and tried to find a common factor linking all them together. I came to the conclusion, that even though throbbers can be very different from each other, the factor that they all have in common, is that they all appear when you're forced to wait for a certain amount of time, for example to enter a website. This idea of time is why I've chosen a clock-design for my throbber. 
After analysing Winnie's code and understanding it, it was relatively easy to compose a line of code which would constitute of my own idea of a throbber, by developing the code that Winnie provided us with. Using Winnie's code for inspiration, I was able to make the necessary alterations to make it work for my own design-idea. 

<b> How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?: </b>
Whenever we want to interact with digital culture, we need a program to make anything happen. As I'm typing this word program now, it's converting my finger-movements on the keyboard to text on the screen. In order for that to happen, we need to have some kind of text program, but also an operating system that can allow the computer to detect the keyboard. Every time we go on the internet, the data that comes into our digital devices needs to be converted into different forms that are useful to us. This is done by using various programs. For example all apps on smartphones are in fact programs that enable us to interact with the digital device.
