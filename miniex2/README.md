<b> What does 'the notion of error' involve?:</b>
The term 'error' accounts for a lot of different things. It is usually understood in connection with recieving a different outcome, from specific actions, than you expected. In my opinion, 'errors' are more likely to be used in connection with computers and programs rather than 'mistakes' which is more focused on humans and their actions. When executing Errors and mistakes, it doesn't result in being the end of the world, because as you name an event with the title 'error', it implies that there is still a possibility to straighten out the consequence of the event. Even though errors and mistakes have a negative sound to them, they often turn out to actually be positive things. 'learn from your mistakes' is a saying you've often heard throughout life, which on many occasions is very true. Mistakes and errors give you a broader understanding of a specific event, and helps you to explore new possibilities and solutions to problems.
