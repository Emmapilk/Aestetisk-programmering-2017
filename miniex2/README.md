<h3><b> What does 'the notion of error' involve?:</b></h3>
The term 'error' accounts for a lot of different things. It is usually understood in connection with recieving a different outcome, from specific actions, than you expected. In my opinion, 'errors' are more likely to be used in connection with computers and programs rather than 'mistakes' which is more focused on humans and their actions. When executing Errors and mistakes, it doesn't result in being the end of the world, because as you name an event with the title 'error', it implies that there is still a possibility to straighten out the consequence of the event. Even though errors and mistakes have a negative sound to them, they often turn out to actually be positive things. 'learn from your mistakes' is a saying you've often heard throughout life, which on many occasions is very true. Mistakes and errors give you a broader understanding of a specific event, and helps you to explore new possibilities and solutions to problems. 

<b><h3>The process of my coding:</h3></b>
As coding still is very new to me, it is quite limited what I'm capable to do at the moment. I never knew what coding was like before this exercise, so it was very interesting to get some insight into this new and foreign world. I wasn't aware that use you pixels to decide your position of different objects, and you constantly have to calculate on the X and Y akses what coordinates are needed for the specific item. As this is my first 

gram i had to code, i tried to keep it simple, so i could get the feel for how the program actually works, without overcomplicating things too much. The result was a line of rectangles next to each other, where my error appears within the missing rectangle (second last rectangle on the right) as a red line. The red color is a conscious choice, as it represents that something isn't as it is supposed to be - an error - resulting in the title, which supports this particular idea.


<b><h3>What constitutes a program?:</h3></b>
A program is something that performs a certain function/task that varies based on imput, user, etc.
