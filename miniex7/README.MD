<b>Description of Checkers</b>
My programme is a grid of checkboxes, when the user clicks on one of these checkboxes another random checkbox is also checked.
The typical usage of checkboxes is to allow a user to select options within a form. This programme does the opposite of what you'd usually expect it to, because it's randomly chooses extra options for you as opposed to just the options you click.

<b>Discussion of objects</b>
An object in object-orientated programming is a representation of an element of a programme, in such a way that it can have multiple variables, functions, etc... associated with it. This allows a programmer to reference specific components and manipulate them independantly.
The advantages of using objects include allowing you to modify the behaviour of an element and its value(s). As well as, representing elements in such a way that they can be stored as variables and modified dynamically.
However the limitations of using objects include over simplifying information relating to an element.
My experience in using objects within this programme, is using checkbox objects to represent my checkbox form elements, I then used these objects to modify the positioning of each individual checkbox. As well as adding behaviour when a checkbox is ticked, that then modifies the "checked" value of another checkbox object.
