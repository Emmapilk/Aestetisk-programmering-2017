<b> A short description of my work, and how it demonstrates the notion of 'feedback': </b>
My programme consists of bubbles appearing on the screen, where you have to pop them by clicking them, before they disappear by themselves. To add some fun, and creating a purpose for popping the bubbles, i decided to make it into a little mini-game, which the 'score' in the bottom left corner illustrates. Every time you pop a bubble, you gain a point, but when you miss a bubble, or 'accidentally' click the background instead you loose a point. I chose to make the score's colors correspendent to the status of the score, which means that if you have a negative score, the text will turn red, as opposed to when you have a positive score, the text turns green.
The feedback in my program is represented through granting the user +1 score, when they do the corect thing ''pop a bubble'', and take away -1 score when they don't do anything, or when they click in the wrong place.

<b> The title of my work: </b>
The title 'Bubble Burster', comes from the growing circles that appear in my program, which are meant to look like and represent bubbles. As my goal with this programme is to get the user to click the bubbles, the title is a signifier for the user to complete this task. Besides, what do you generally do with bubbles? - POP that shiit! :D
Because of this, i found the title "Bubble Burster" appropriate.
