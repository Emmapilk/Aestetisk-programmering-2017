<b> The Title of my work, and description of programme: </b>
I have chosen to call my programme for "Toilet Poetry" as my programme based upon the found literature you can find on public toilets. It's a funny concept to build a foundation of a programme from the creative poems you can find on the walls, from people doing their business, while being in a creative mood - but sometimes you find comments on these walls, that really stick to your mind. The concept of my programme is to keep <b> clicking the picture of the public toilet </b>, to explore some of the possible messages you can find in a public bathroom. The found text, in my programme, comes from other people who has noted down poems or comments, which they have found interesting, an therefor my programme gives a broader perspective on what you actually can find on these walls, but it also gives these messages more attention - the question is of course weather this should be seen as encouragement to keep up the creative work, but it also builds upon a foundation of what vandalism is and how many people actually take participation in it.

<b> Functions used from RiTa library: </b>
I had a lot of trouble making my 'found text' visible in my programme, and tried a lot of different things until i figured out that the code needed a local server enable to run. I havn't really used any of the RiTa library functions, as the p5.js library was sufficient enough, to cover the functions i needed, enable to make my interpretation of this exercise work. 

<b> My experience in working with 'found text' as the source material: </b>
It occured to me that this exercise was very wide and therefor open to many different interpretations. Working within this wide spectre of possible interpretation, made me realise how hard it was for me to come up with an idea. Reflecting upon the different possibilities has always been a big help to me, so continuing my usual every day errands helped me realize, that this concept of poetry on public toilets definitely had potential. In the start i was worried that it wouldn't be possible to find any litterature about poems on public toilets, but as it turns out, other peole have also given this concept some thought, and loads of people have posted loads of information about these poems online. So I went looking through some different comments - and direct quotes people have made on these messages on the walls - and gathered a couple of interesting or funny findings in a textfile, to use it in my programme.

<b>The materiality of my 'found text': </b>
Many people have very different opinions upon these messages, tags and graffiti sprayings you can find on public toilets, and where some would probably look at it as vandalism - and a subject that is far from art, other people might say, that it's an open space for anyone who wants to express themselves (in temrs of love, anger, political messages or simply to whine about something), where one can permit to say whatever is on one's mind, as it in a large degree is very anonymous.
