<b> My Programme: </b>
My programme consists of different trees getting created and displayed every three seconds. It involves a few simple rules, but because these rules involve slight changes in the setup, there won't be any trees that are the same - every tree displayed is unique in its own way.

<b> The rules of my programme: </b>
 - Every tree has a completely vertical trunk in the middle of the canvas.
 - Every Branch is always connected to 3 other branches.
 - For every branch-extension of the tree, the next 'generation' of branches will always shrink with about 30%.
 - Every new branch that is created, has a different color
 - The angles in which the branches a placed compared to each other has always got an angle between 0 and 90 degrees.
 - When the length of the branches becomes smaller than 10 pixels, the continuation of the branch extension will be cancelled.
 - After every third second a new tree with the included rules above will be created.


<b> Generativity in my programme: </b>
My programme is generative, because it follows some specific rules, which are noted above, and therefrom generates it's own art. My programme shows emergant behavior, as the tree changes after every three seconds, but i believe that this could have been executed better, as you don't actually see the process of the tree being created. Perhaps the emergent behavior would have been expressed better, if you could step by step see where the programme would choose to place the next branch, at which angle and with what colour.
